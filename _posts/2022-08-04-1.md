We first state the open mapping theorem.

**Theorem (Open Mapping)** &nbsp; Any continuous surjection between Banach spaces is open.

The equivalence of norms can be proved easily via the open mapping theorem as follows.

**Theorem** &nbsp; Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space. Then any two norms on $V$ induce the same topology.

**proof.** &nbsp; Without loss of generality, let $V = \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ be a norm and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_{1}$ be the $1$-norm on $V$. Let $\{ \mathbf{e_{1}}, \ldots, \mathbf{e_{n}} \}$ be the standard basis of $V$ and $M = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \lVert\mathbf{e_{i}}\rVert$.

For any $\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\mathbf{e_{i}} \in V$, the inequality

$$\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lVert x_{i}\mathbf{e_{i}}\rVert
\leq M \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lvert x_{i}\rvert
= M \lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert_{1}$$

shows that the identity map $(V,\lVert\cdot\rVert_{1}) \to (V,\lVert\cdot\rVert)$ is continuous. Thus, it is open by the open mapping theorem, and therefore any norm on $V$ induces the same topology as $1$-norm.
