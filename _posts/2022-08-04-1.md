We first state the open mapping theorem.<br>
**Theorem (Open Mapping)** Any continuous surjection between Banach spaces is open.

<br>

The equivalence of norms can be proved easily via the open mapping theorem as follows.

<br>

**Theorem** Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space. Then any two norms on $V$ induce the same topology.
