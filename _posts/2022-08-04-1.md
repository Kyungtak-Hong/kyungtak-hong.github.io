We first state the open mapping theorem.
&nbsp;
**Theorem (Open Mapping)** Any continuous surjection between Banach spaces is open.

The equivalence of norms can be proved easily via the open mapping theorem as follows.

**Theorem** Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space. Then any two norms on $V$ induce the same topology.

*proof.*
