The notion of "maximal" essential extension of a module is in general defined only when it is contained in another module. However, such containment is not necessary for the case of integral domains since their quotient fields are in fact the final objects in the category of essential extensions.

**Lemma** &nbsp; Let $D$ be an integral domain and $F$ be its quotient field. Then $F$ is an injective $D$-module.

**proof.** &nbsp; Using Baer's criterion, it is enough to show that any $D$-module homomorphism $f : I \to F$ from an ideal $I$ of $D$ has an extension $\bar{f} : D \to F$.

The case $I=0$ is clear, so assume that $I \neq 0$ and let $r \in I$ be a nonzero element. Since $F$ is a divisible $D$-module, there exists $x \in F$ such that $f(r) = rx$. Now define $\bar{f} : D \to F$ to be $\bar{f}(a) = ax$. For any $a \in I$, the equation

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
r\bar{f}(a) \;=\; rax \;=\; af(r) \;=\; f(ar) \;=\; rf(a)
\end{equation}$$

holds. Since $F$ is a torsion-free $D$-module, ($\ref{eq:1}$) implies that $\bar{f}(a) = f(a)$ and therefore $\bar{f}$ is an extension of $f$. $\blacksquare$

_**Remark**_ &nbsp; The statement in general holds for the case when $F$ is a divisible torsion-free $D$-module.

**Theorem** &nbsp; Every essential extension of an integral domain can be embedded into its quotient field.

**proof.** &nbsp; Let $D$ be an integral domain, $F$ be its quotient field and $E$ be an essential extension of $D$.

Since $F$ is injective, the inclusion $D \to F$ has an extension $\phi : E \to F$. The equation

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\mathrm{Ker}(\phi) \cap D \;=\; \mathrm{Ker}(D \to F) \;=\; 0
\end{equation}$$

together with $E$ being an essential extension of $D$ implies that $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi) = 0$, and therefore $\phi$ is injective. $\blacksquare$
