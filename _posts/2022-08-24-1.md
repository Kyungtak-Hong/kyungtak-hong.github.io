The proof is analogous to the Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes.

**Theorem** &nbsp; Algebraically closed fields are infinite.

**proof.** &nbsp; Let $F=\\{a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}\\}$ be a finite field. Then the polynomial $f(x) = 1+\prod\_{i=0}^{n} (x-a\_{i})$ does not have a root in $F$. Thus $F$ is not algebraically closed. $\blacksquare$
